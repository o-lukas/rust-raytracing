# Rust-Raytracing

This repository contains my first steps using Rust. 

To get familiar with the programming language and eco-system I will try to implement the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io) project.

I will try to create a single commit for each chapter of the book. But as I was going through the first chapters I learned that I must amend previous code pretty often, so there might be additional commits for code of previous chapters later on.
